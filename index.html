		<h1>Swoltography</h1>
	
		<p>Swoltography is a hobby run photography service and website. It is currently
		operated and maintained by myself with the goal of acting as an endpoint to
		host and share my photography. This website is also the central location from
		which I share collections created for individual users and clients.</p>
