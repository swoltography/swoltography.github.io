        <h3>Sony &alpha;6000</h3>
        <p>
            My main camera is the &alpha;6000. The &alpha;6000 is a mirrorless digital camera 
            from Sony. I purchased it on sale from Best&nbsp;Buy about 6 years ago. Since then, 
            I have grown to love this camera even though it does have some limitations. 
            The thing I love most about this camera is its compact body. With a weight 
            of just 12.13oz (without a lens) this camera is easy to carry in the hand 
            without fatigue. The camera sports a 24.3 Megapixel sensor in the APS-C form 
            factor. APS-C refers to the physical size of the sensor and is about 1.5 times 
            smaller than a full frame camera (full frame is 35mm film equivalent). Like 
            all other sony mirrorless systems this camera uses E-mount lenses. The sheer 
            popularity of this camera system, and other E-mount cameras, means that there 
            are a wide variety of compatible lenses that can be used on the camera that can 
            fit into most budgets. However not everything is perfect with this camera. 
            I wish it had the in-body image stabilization that some of its newer brothers 
            like the A6600 have. The &alpha;6000 only supports in-lens stabilization which not 
            every lens has. That being said, using a faster shutter speed can be used to 
            prevent blurry images when stabilization isnt available.

        <h3>Nikon F2A</h3>
        <p>
            The Nikon F2 is the opposite end of the spectrum from my &alpha;6000. The Nikon F2 is a 
            fully mechanical film camera that was launched in 1970 and was Nikon’s second SLR 
            camera that it launched. The F2 was marketed as a professional 35mm film camera and
            as such was built with many features and offered many optional upgrades. The different 
            “models” of F2 simply denote which of the 6 interchangeable viewfinders are attached. 
            My F2 is known as an F2A which means it has the standard F2 body (all F2 bodies are 
            the same) but with the Photonic A viewfinder (DP-11). Photomic is simply a brand name 
            and all Nikon F2 Finders are Photomic. DP-11 is the model and means that the finder has 
            a built-in light meter to help get the right exposure. One thing cool thing to note is 
            that the lens mount is the Nikon F bayonet mount, which is still in use today. This 
            means that you can use modern lenses on the F2 as long as they support manual focus 
            and manual aperture control. The F2 has all metal construction, with a leather covering
            for grip, and is quite heavy considering it. With no lens attached it is heavier than my 
            &alpha;6000 and both of its lenses combined. As such I only use it with the neck strap 
            because hand carrying the camera all day will easily fatigue your arms. Despite this 
            I love the feel of the camera in my hands and the mechanical feel of all the dials 
            when using it. However, its biggest downside is easily the cost of operation. Film 
            and its development, while still available, is not as cheap as it once was and gives 
            it a high cost of use.

        <h3>Nikkor F 50mm F1.4 AI</h3>
        <p>
            Currently I only own one lens for my F2, the Nikkor 50mm f 1.4 Ai lens. 
            Nikkor is Nikon’s own brands for lenses and has been known in the past 
            for making high quality glass. This lens is a prime lens which means it 
            has a fixed focal length (50mm) rather than being able to zoom in or out. 
            50 mm is a great general purpose focal length. Funny enough even though this 
            is the oldest lens I own it is also the fastest with a maximum aperture of 
            f1.4. With out getting too technical the aperture is a measurement of how 
            “wide” the opening inside the lens is and is measured in f-stops. An f-stop 
            is an approximation of how much light is able to pass through the lens. The 
            lower the F number, 1.4 in this case, the more light can enter the lens.

        <h3>Sony E F4.5-6.3 55-210mm OSS</h3>
        <p>
            Of my two lenses for the &alpha;6000 this lens is my favorite. 
            The 55-210mm telephoto is a sharp lens especially for being a kit lens. 
            A kit lens is a lens that is typically bundled with a camera. They are 
            typically more budget friendly and of lower quality than the mid to high 
            end offerings. This lens is sharpest in the 55-135 range with image quality 
            falling off and chromatic aberration increasing as you approach 210mm. 
            Chromatic aberration is the term used to describe the color fringing cause 
            by the splitting of light into each of its colors (like a prism). This causes 
            edges of photographed items to have multiple edges in different colors and 
            results in a loss of sharpness/detail. Using the included lens hood helps 
            reduce the effects of chromatic aberration but does not eliminate it entirely. 
            The 55-210 also sports OSS (Optical Steady Shot) which is Sony’s branding for 
            lenses that have in lens stabilization. This helps keep the image still even 
            if you can’t hold the camera still, this is helpful at the telephoto end of 
            the zoom range, but a tripod may still be needed in scenes with a lot of motion.

            <h3>Sony E F3.5-5.6 PZ 16-50mm OSS</h3>
            <p>
                My other lens for the Sony &alpha;6000 is the 16-50mm “pancake” lens. 
                Its referred to as “pancake” due to its short and wide shape similar 
                to that of a pancake. This lens sports a power zoom, which can be helpful 
                to get a smoother zooming motion if shooting video. However, I always prefer 
                a manual zoom when shooting stills. While this lens is very compact and 
                lightweight it achieves this at the cost of higher distortion and reduced 
                sharpness. The camera does a fair job correcting the distortion with the 
                in camera photo processing but it isn’t perfect. Shooting complex subjects 
                with few straight lines will help minimize how noticeable the distortion 
                can be. Like the 55-210mm this lens also has OSS, but I find it to be less 
                helpful due to the lens being a wide-angle lens. Wide-angle lenses tend to 
                be better at hiding the effects of an unsteady camera. Overall I think 
                this is a good lens but you do have to be aware of its limitations when 
                shooting with it.
