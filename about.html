		<p>Welcome to Swoltography! I invite you to join me on a photographic journey! 
		My name is Andrew Swol and I have been a hobby photographer for over 7 years. 
		This website serves to showcase some of my favorite photographic works as well 
		as deliver that are entertaining, informative, and current photography subjects.
		This website is a personal project of mine, and its direction is likely to change 
		over time as my photography, passions, and goals change. However, I hope that 
		you will stay a part of this continuing adventure wherever it may lead.
		</p>
		<p>My foray into photography started in my senior year in high school when 
		I decided to join the yearbook committee. Admittedly, at the time my knowledge 
		of even the was nonexistent lacking at the time. However, the class allowed me
		to get my toes wet in a controlled and directed environment which provided the 
		perfect training ground to experience the core concepts of photography. From 
		the first assignment I was hooked and discovered a love for capturing moments 
		and memories through the lens of a camera. Since then, I've continued to 
		develop my skills and explore the world of photography and continue to experiment 
		on my own.
		</p>
		<p>As a photographer, I'm drawn to a variety of subjects, including landscapes,
		natural objects, and urban settings. However, I am not drawn to any specific 
		“genre” of photography. Photography for me is another way to appreciate the 
		world around us. It allows me to view the world through a different lens 
		(pun intended) than what I would normally. Observing the world in terms of 
		color, lighting, and composition helps me gain a better appreciation of the 
		subjects and scenes that I encounter throughout life. 
		</p>
		
		<p>Although I don't have any formal training in photography, I'm constantly 
		learning and experimenting as I go, trying out new techniques and 
		refining my style. My main goal with my photography is simply to enjoy 
		the world as it is around us and hopefully pass some of that enjoyment 
		on to others. This website serves as an outlet so that my appreciation 
		for the world and its endless combination of subjects can be shared 
		with any visitors that come across it.
		</p>
